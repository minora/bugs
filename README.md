## Should I post an issue?
* If your issue is related to individual payments or account support, please email support@minora.me instead of posting the issue here.
* __Pro Tip!__ If you think you've found an exploit, don't post the issue here. Instead, contact exploits@minora.me 

## Posting an issue
Creating a new issue on the tracker is simple:

1. Use the search bar on the top navigation bar to search for your issue first, if it doesn't exist keep following these steps.
2. Head to https://github.com/minora/bugs/issues/new
3. Give the issue an appropriate title __Upgrade not working__ instead of __Upgrade__ - remember specific titles can help use eradicate duplicates on the public and internal issue tracker.
4. Describe the issue with a short summary, followed by steps on how to reproduce the issue - http://dillinger.io/ describes the markdown syntax to use for formating. 
5. __Pro Tip!__ Although this step is optional it's really helpful when (if possible) you can include a screenshot of the issue that you're describing (drag and drop works).
